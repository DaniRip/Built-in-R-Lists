# Built-in-R-Lists
A quick function to locate all the data sets with a general list structure in the standard R datasets library.
The motivation for this file is general teaching purposes. I find it helps to have a real-world example of each datastructure learned, but the data frame format is most common.
This can be adapted rapidly to check for vector, matrix or data frame structures as well. 

Hopefully this helps other people looking for teaching examples (or how to index through the set of datasets for any reasons!)

The output on my computer is currently: "Harman23.cor" "Harman74.cor" "ability.cov"  "state.center", but this might change between versions of R.
